# Zotero Style of the Sorbonne Student Law Review

This project aims at developping a zotero stylesheet compatible with the [Sorbonne Student Law Review citation style](https://sorbonnestudentlawreview.org/charters/charte-en.pdf). 

 ## Project progress
 
This style is a beta version. It works with zotero and gives satisfactory results, though it still contains numerous errors. We advise you to regularly re-download this style so as to benefit from the most recent edits. 
Issues with this style can be raised directly on Github or at the following email address: zotero@sorbonnestudentlawreview.org.

## Style language

This style is optimised for English or French, but is designed to work with any locale supported by https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales.
